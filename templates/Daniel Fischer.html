        <p class="lead">My passion is creating, and I find happiness in being a better me today than the me yesterday.</p>
        <p>My pipedream is for extraterrestrial contact; preferrably a ship coming to Earth. I'd settle for being a coloniser
            on Mars though.</p>

            <p>
                Daniel Fischer is one of the most talented, intelligent, consistent and genuinely good hearted people that I have had the
                opportunity to work with.
                <br>
                <br> Daniel possess an incredibly rare mix of design awareness, development talent and business intelligence.
                He is my go-to tech resource (Pocket CTO if you will) and quite honestly, has impressed me with positive
                outcomes on every project that I've had the opportunity to work with him on.

                Daniel is a great guy to work with. Good spirit, competent, and more than willing to put to long hours in to meet our deadline
                --- H works with a lot of structure and understanding in a area of web development where this is rare. He's
                got a eye for design and good coding sense.

                Daniel is a highly talented designer and thinker. Daniel can quickly understand what our needs are, what our audience expects
                and quickly speak to that. His work ethics is stellar as his expertise. I would be thrilled to get to work
                with Daniel again and I highly recommend him. </p>

                This is the first time I am writing a LinkedIn recommendation for someone voluntarily - and Daniel truly deserves it. Daniel
                took over the project at a very critical time. Within 3 months of the project, the team rallied around him
                and rewrote and delivered the entire real-time messaging platform (API, data model, web front-end, and hybrid
                mobile apps) under tremendous constraints. Daniel simplified the engineering processes, works extremely well
                with the entire team, pays great attention to details, and always follow up/through. Best part is that he's
                multidisciplinary. Apart from being a great product manager, he understands UX/UI and is an excellent hands-on
                coder. Daniel is grace under pressure and I will work with him again anytime.

            <p>
                Daniel is one of those extremely rare individuals who can both design and code with equal fluency. As a user interface and
                user experience desiger and implementer, he really does speak the 'native language of the web' with impressive
                chops in HTML/CSS using HAML and SASS, and JavaScript. His Ruby on Rails knowledge is impressive, and his
                ability to command jQuery is incredibly useful for a UI developer who is also a skilled designer.
